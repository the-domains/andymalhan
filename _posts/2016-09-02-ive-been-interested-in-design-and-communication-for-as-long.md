I've been interested in design and communication for as long as I remember. 

Recurring tile patterns on floors would keep me mesmerised for hours, _"Where does the pattern begin and end?_" The fact that you could recognise printed communication as being from a certain company, _without seeing the name_, was fascinating to my teenage mind. Lettering, the analysis of how different companies treated typography; How they wrote their name; _How I wrote my own name_; filled my head and my notebooks. 

My doodling and scribbling also filled my textbooks and adorned my desks -- much to the annoyance of my teachers. One particular math teacher, at [Woodstock School][0], Mr. Sinclair, refused to issue me a school-owned text book, and wrote a letter to my parents complaining about my incessant doodling. He added, in some bafflement, that I was even doodling in other people's textbooks! We lived in Guyana at the time, and my father had to order the text from London. He wasn't pleased.

Funnily enough, my favourite subjects in school were mathamatics and physics. I had, in my father's words, "...an engineering bend of mind." and went on to study Computer Science in the US. A year or so after returning to India, I told him I wanted to open a design and communications studio. He looked at me as if I had a hole in my head and quipped, "Why have we spent all this money on Computer Science? You could have just studied design!"

Hindsight, of course, is 20-20\. When you look back, it is easy to connect the dots. I've doodled my way through life and have enrolled in art courses all through school and college. When I meet old friends and talk about what I do for work, they almost always say, "I knew you'd do something creative."

Go figure.

[So in 1998 I opened TSA Effects][1].
