  I'm a graphic designer, photographer and visual communication strategist that
  is part cool, part geek and part technology junkie. Expect to see a lot of
  that stuff here; It is what drives me, and what I'll write about. A few years
  ago, I was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson's Disease, so expect to see
  some of that too.

![At the Great Wall of China, with my wife. It's incredible. So is she.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d61c68bc-00b4-4a18-8d6a-5146025c8fad.jpg)

I'm a [graphic designer][0], [photographer][1] and [visual communication strategist ][2]that is part cool, part geek and part technology junkie. Expect to see a lot of that stuff here; It is what drives me, and what I'll write about. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with early onset [Parkinson's Disease,][3] so expect to see some of that too.

I was born in Dehradun, India, at the foothills of the glorious Himalayan mountains. When I was a couple of months old, my family moved to Zambia, and from there, everywhere. I'm now in my 40s and have lived in Zambia, India, Guyana, the USA and currently Shanghai, China.

There are stories about all those moves. I'll get to them eventually.
